**Truth or Dare Project (2022)**
 

**Project Summary:**

This project is a "Truth or Dare" game that integrates artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology. The robot begins by spinning around randomly and then stops automatically in front of one of the people present. Afterward, it uses facial recognition to identify the person and asks them to choose between "Truth" or "Dare." Based on the person's choice, the robot presents either a truth question or a dare challenge for them to complete.

**Acknowledgements:**

I would like to express my gratitude to Purpose for their support and resources in making this project possible. A special thanks to Eng. Meqdad Darwish, thank you for your invaluable teaching and guidance throughout all stages of my learning journey. His dedication and expertise were instrumental in the success of this project.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Python**: The primary programming language used to develop the project and implement the game logic.
- **OpenCV**: A library used for face detection and image processing.
- **Face Recognition**: A library used to recognize faces based on pre-trained data.
- **TFLite (TensorFlow Lite)**: Used to run a lightweight machine learning model that classifies the person's choice between "Truth" or "Dare."
- **PIL (Pillow)**: A library for image processing.
- **Imutils**: Provides convenience functions to work with video streams and image processing.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading facial recognition data.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used to create the backend of the application and manage interactions between the game logic and the user interface.
- **HTML and CSS**: For designing the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity to the user interface.
